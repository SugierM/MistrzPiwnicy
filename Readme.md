This project was almost entirely vibe‑coded.


It’s designed to help a friend run tabletop RPG sessions more smoothly by combining notes, visuals, and music control in one place.


The app runs a local Flask server on your computer, allowing you to control everything from another device connected to the same Wi‑Fi network — like your phone or tablet. That way, the Game Master can prepare scenes, show images, and adjust background music effortlessly during a session.


To install, simply run setup.bat, which prepares everything automatically.
To start the server, run run_app.bat; a browser window will open with the app interface.
You’ll also see generated local links that can be opened on your phone or smart TV (as long as they’re on the same Wi‑Fi) to either control or see what should be seen.


The project uses Google Drive integration to store and access data across different computers, so it takes a bit more setup. Should work on any operating system, though running it on Windows is easiest thanks to the included .bat scripts.
